# Twitter API library for NodeJS

* Supports version 1.1 of Twitter's [REST](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public) and [Streaming](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) APIs
* See examples directory for usage


## Install

`npm install twitter-api`


## NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED

I wrote this library several years ago when I was doing a lot of Twitter API development and was interested in Node JS.
I don't do much of either nowadays, so this library is likely to go for years without development.
Please don't expect pull requests to be merged very quickly.
